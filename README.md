## Communities

This was the main project for the course 'Probabilistic Methods for Complex Networks(DDCDM)'. <br>

book: Network Science by Albert-Laszlo Barabasi ( http://networksciencebook.com/). <br>

I had to pick a section from the book above and make a detailed presentation of it. I picked section 9, which analyzes communities and hierarchy in Real Networks and also presents two algorithms of Hierarchical Clustering. <br>
